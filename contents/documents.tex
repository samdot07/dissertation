\chapter*{Official Manuscripts}
\textit{In this chapter, I have put together a list of manuscripts where direct access to primary sources was not possible. In these cases, I have relied on Eric Williams' citations in Capitalism and Slavery as a secondary source. Efforts were made to access and verify these manuscripts through available university libraries and online resources. Where possible, specific sources were cited based on the information provided by Williams.}
