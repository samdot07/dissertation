\noindent\textit{This dissertation is based on Eric E. Williams' book Capitalism and Slavery. Throughout the text, anytime I came across a work referenced by Williams, I attempted to locate and consult these sources directly relying on the university library and online resources. When I was able to find and verify these sources, I cited them directly. When I was unable to identify the original documentation on my own, I referred to Williams' work as an intermediary source. This approach ensures that both Williamsâ€™ fundamental contributions and my own research efforts in verifying and locating sources are properly acknowledged, preserving academic integrity.}
